# Glinda Witch - CSS Witch Transformation

This project is based on an amazing CSS witch created by [Alvaro Montoro](https://codepen.io/alvaromontoro) (originally an Elphaba-inspired design). I've transformed it into a Glinda-inspired witch, complete with some new features and customizations. 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform the original Elphaba-inspired design into a Glinda-inspired witch. The design makes use of CSS for styling, animation, and effects to bring Glinda's character to life.

## Key Features

- **Glinda-inspired Witch Design**: A CSS witch design modeled after Glinda, featuring a distinctively styled gown, hair, and overall aesthetic.
- **Based on Alvaro Montoro's Elphaba Witch**: The initial concept is derived from Alvaro Montoroâ€™s Elphaba Witch design, providing the base for this transformation.

## Future Enhancements

There are several planned additions and improvements to further refine the design:

- **Crown**: A beautifully designed crown will be added to complete Glinda's look. The crown will feature a glowing, sparkling effect to emphasize her magical nature.
- **Realistic Hair**: The hair design will be enhanced with more detailed and realistic textures, aiming to create a more lifelike and dynamic appearance.
